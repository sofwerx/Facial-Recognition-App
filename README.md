## SOFWERX Team modifications
We will be working to build a proprietary app using the original design by Michael Sladoje and Mike Schälchli. The features we intend to add are a notification a work team system. So that if a face in the app's "Added Persons" library is identified a notification will be sent to the operator of the app.
